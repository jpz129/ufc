Still a work in progress.  I would like to learn some PyTorch and apply those techniques to this analysis in the coming days.  

This project seeks to predict whether the underdog or favorite will win a given UFC fight.  I used a random forest classifier for my modeling approach.  The predictions also include the expected value of bets placed per fighter.
